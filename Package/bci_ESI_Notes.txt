Version dated June 14, 2016 (Continuous Control Paradigm)

Standalone package:

Key Features:


SYSTEM PARAMETERS:
-select EEG sensors via pop-up window
-signal generator sensor locations not organized
-downsampling factor (applies to all EEG data in source imaging/training/online)


SOURCE IMAGING PARAMETERS:
-Default anatomy and sample BEM models (Headmodels) for all five EEG systems
-Custom ROI(s) discontinued
-Select brain regions for regression
-Multivariate source prelocalization for parcellation of cortex (requires training data)
-No check to make sure training data compatible with selected EEG system
-Data driven noise estimation no thoroughly tested
-fMRI weighting unchanged


TRAINING DATA PARAMETERS
-Only set up for BCI2000.dat files (can use stimulus presentation or cursor task data files)
-Parallel linear regression on all sensors and/or brain parcels
     -One vs. one, one vs. all, one vs. rest regression
     -All sensors, all dipoles, all parcels
-Display all frequencies as image plot or single frequency as brain/topo
-Load regression is a dead button


BCI PARAMETERS:
-Select data window for analysis
-Select update window
-Select up to three dimensional control signals
     -Dimension, task competition, frequency
     -1Hz frequency analysis from broadband filtered data (frequency bounds defined in system parameters)
     -stepwise linear regression with backward step removal on selected frequency to identify best locations
     -(no method to identify best frequency)
     -Normalizer settings unchanged

DISPLAY PARAMETERS:
-Unchanged for electrode activity, source activity, low resolution source activity, normalizer
-Saved files can be visualized independently (frequency parameter no longer applies)
